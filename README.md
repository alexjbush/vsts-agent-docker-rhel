# CentOS/RHEL VSTS Docker Agents

Unofficial images for the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) agent for CentOS/RHEL 7.2.
These are forked from: [https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent-docker](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent-docker)

Hopefully Microsoft create official VSTS agents for RHEL in the future.

You can find them built at: [https://hub.docker.com/r/bushnoh/vsts-agent-docker-rhel/](https://hub.docker.com/r/bushnoh/vsts-agent-docker-rhel/)

## Building custom versions

You can run `python build.py` to generate custom Dockerfiles in the [`build`](build/) folder.
